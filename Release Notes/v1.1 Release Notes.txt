NerrBot: ReHatched v1.1 Release Notes
Can you believe that NerrBot: ReHatched has been out for just about two months now?
Changelog:
• Fixed the bug where at the end of a tictactoe match, NerrBot checks for a tie by seeing if the board is full before he checks for a winner
• Made the tictactoe winner messages look fancy
• Capped the maximum number of coins to be flipped in the flip command to one million. The roll command is not impacted by this.
• Created a new "Ready" message to be posted upon connection.
• A question mark is now required at the end of a question to use the yesno command.
• Added a large library of 62 preset responses (including variations of the same questions) for specific questions with the yesno command. There is some lenience with capitalization and using nicknames (i.e. Shadoo instead of TheEvilShadoo or TTYD instead of Paper Mario: TTYD), but make sure to always type a question mark at the end of the qustion.
• Added a single secret response for the yesno command where the response is neither yes nor no.
• Added a library of 30 preset rating responses (including variations of the same things) for specific things to be rated with the rate command.

Looking to add a lastseen command and maybe cleanup the log in the next update. I still need more suggestions too.
