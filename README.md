# NerrBot-ReHatched
Nerr 3.0 just got a little less bland: NerrBot: ReHatched is finally here! Inspired by the original NerrBot by Gold Prognosticus on the one and only [digibutter.nerr](http://digibutter.nerr.biz). Continue forth into the future, digibutter! Repository made public on 10/9/2021

#### Note:
In order to run NerrBot: ReHatched, you must have two system environment variables named "NB_email" and "NB_password" set to the email address and password respectively that you would like your instance of NerrBot to use.
